    //Time complexity : O(n).
    //
    //Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while
    //loop nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be
    //linear. Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks
    //the beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in
    //nums), the while loop can only run for n iterations throughout the
    //entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like
    //O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n+n)=O(n)
    //time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall
    //runtime is linear.
    //
    //Space complexity : O(n).
    //
    //In order to set up O(1) containment lookups, we allocate linear space
    //for a hash table to store the O(n) numbers in nums. Other than that,
    //the space complexity is identical to that of the brute force solution.
