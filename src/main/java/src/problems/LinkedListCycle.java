    //The fast pointer reaches the end first and the run time depends on the list's length, which is O(n).
    //List has a cycle:
    //We break down the movement of the slow pointer into two steps, the non-cyclic part and the cyclic part:
    //
    //The slow pointer takes "non-cyclic length" steps to enter the cycle. At this point, the fast pointer has already reached the cycle. Number of iterations=non-cyclic length=N
    //
    //Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the fast runner moves 2 steps while the slow runner moves 1 steps at a time. Since the speed difference is 1, it takes
    //difference of speed
    //distance between the 2 runners
    //â€‹
    //  loops for the fast runner to catch up with the slow runner.As the distance is at most cyclic length K - 1 and the speed difference is 1, we conclude that
    //Number of iterations=at most cyclic length K - 1.
    //
    //Therefore, the worst case time complexity is O(N+K), which is O(n).

    //We only use two nodes (slow and fast) so the space complexity is O(1).
